This project is an example of using the [ag-grid](https://www.ag-grid.com) library in a React app.

It is based on ag-grid examples. The only goal is to be able to quickly play with ag-grid and test some features.

# Getting Started
The project was created using Create React App, so use `yarn start` to run it on a local dev server.
